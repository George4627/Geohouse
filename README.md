# Geohouse
Part of Spacetech Europe Hackaton 2021. This project was aimed at calculating actual price for sold houses in Ukraine using it's own formula.
This would indicate whenther sold house or flat is worth it's money(cheaper than it should be or nearing stated price) or if it's overly expensive for what it worth.
This repo only contains website on Django, which displays already calculated info. Site uses JS library Leaflet to display geographical points.
